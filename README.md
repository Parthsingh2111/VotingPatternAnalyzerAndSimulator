# Voting Simulation and Pattern Analysis

## Project Overview
The **Voting Simulation and Pattern Analysis** project is a backend-focused data analysis tool designed to provide political parties with comprehensive insights into voting behaviors and demographics. This project combines data storage, real-time insights, and automated querying to allow for streamlined analysis and visualization of voting trends.

**Project Duration**: January 2024 - Present

## Key Features
- **Voting Patterns Analysis**: Analyzes voting behaviors across 5+ interactive dashboards, highlighting political geography, voter demographics, and candidate insights.
- **Data Storage Insights**: Ensures secure data storage and real-time insights using Metabase, enabling data-driven decision-making with advanced aggregation techniques.
- **Automated Querying**: Supports over 20 complex aggregation pipeline queries in Metabase, automating data queries to examine voter behavior patterns.
- **Data Management Optimization**: Uses integrated version control and streamlined query pipelines to enhance data handling efficiency.
- **Bug Analytics Dashboards**: Features a version-agnostic dashboard in Metabase to improve query accuracy, monitor bugs, and support quick resolution.

## Technologies Used
- **Backend**: Node.js, Express, MongoDB
- **Data Visualization & Storage**: Metabase, MongoDB
- **Version Control**: Git

## Accessing Metabase Dashboards
1. Log in to your Metabase instance using your configured credentials.
2. Access the dashboards for voting pattern insights, bug analytics, and demographic data.

### **Disclaimer**
> Metabase does not allow free hosting of this project. Due to the high hosting costs, the project has not been hosted publicly. Instead, I am providing images of the project interface and key dashboard features below.
